<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently in my senior year at the University of Minnesota, majoring in Chemical Engineering, 
    pursing minors in both Mathematics and Chemistry. I am expected to graduate May of 2024 with Latin Honors. 
    I am an undergraduate researchers working with Prof. Paul Dauenhauer on a project funded by the Center for 
    Programmable Energy Catalysis. My research focuses on simualtion of a loop reaction on a dynamic catalyst surface, 
    exploring the parameter space to develop an understanding of how catalyst perturbation can induce net flow of 
    molecules about the reactive loop. </p>

<p>I am currently applying to a number of graduate programs to pursue a PhD in Chemical Engineering. My research 
    interests include computational catalysis, electrocatalysis, and machine learning. I intend to pursue research 
    on machine learning methods to help deepen the understanding of electrocatalyst design and increase the efficiency 
    of the search for novel electrocataylsts for application in energy-related electrocatalytic conversion of small 
    molecules.</p>

<p>Prior to my undergraduate studies in Minnesota, I grew up in Lakewood, CO.</p>
