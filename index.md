I am currently in my senior year at the University of Minnesota, majoring in Chemical Engineering, pursing minors in both Mathematics and Chemistry. I am expected to graduate May of 2024 with Latin Honors. I am an undergraduate researchers working with Prof. Paul Dauenhauer on a project funded by the Center for Programmable Energy Catalysis. My research focuses on simualtion of a loop reaction on a dynamic catalyst surface, exploring the parameter space to develop an understanding of how catalyst perturbation can induce net flow of molecules about the reactive loop. 

I am currently applying to a number of graduate programs to pursue a PhD in Chemical Engineering. My research interests include computational catalysis, electrocatalysis, and machine learning. I intend to pursue research on machine learning methods to help deepen the understanding of electrocatalyst design and increase the efficiency of the search for novel electrocataylsts for application in energy-related electrocatalytic conversion of small molecules. 

Prior to my undergraduate studies in Minnesota, I grew up in Lakewood, CO.
