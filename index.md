I am currently in my senior year at the University of Minnesota, majoring in Chemical Engineering, pursing minors in both Mathematics and Chemistry. I am expected to graduate May of 2024 with Latin Honors. I am an undergraduate researcher working with Prof. Paul Dauenhauer on a project funded by the Center for Programmable Energy Catalysis. My research focuses on simulation of a loop reaction on a dynamic catalyst surface, exploring the parameter space to develop an understanding of how catalyst perturbation can induce net flow of molecules about the reactive loop. 

I am currently applying to graduate programs to pursue a PhD in Chemical Engineering. My research interests include computational catalysis, electrocatalysis, and machine learning. I have interest in pursuing research on machine learning methods to help deepen the understanding of electrocatalysts through increasing the accuracy of modeling of the electrochemical interface. This research will help accelerate the search for novel electrocataylsts for application in energy-related electrocatalytic conversion of small molecules. 

Prior to my undergraduate studies in Minnesota, I grew up in a suburb of Denver, CO. In my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, backpacking, weightlifting, and yoga.
