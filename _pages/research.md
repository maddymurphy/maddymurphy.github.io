My current research interests lie in the development of computational methods and machine learning algorithms for advancement of electrochemical reactions. With increasing demand for renewable power sources in response to the current global climate crisis, there is a need for rapid growth in the catalyts that are used in the relevant energy-related electrocatalytic reactions. The conventional method for discovery of energy materials based on trial-and-error can take up to a decade or longer, reinforcing the need for a method of rapid catalyst discovery. Machine learning holds the capability to identify structure-activity relationships within historic databases that can be used to accelerate the discovery and design of novel electrocatalysts. The use of computational chemistry in this field can bring about rapid change and development in the understanding of electrocatalysts for applications that have positive impacts in the field of renewable energy.

### Circumfluence of Programmable Catalytic Loops

Catalytic resonance theory introduces the idea of catalyst modulation to yield turnover frequencies that exceed the Sabatier maximum, the static catalyst maximum rate. As many surface chemistries are comprised of networks of elementary steps, it is proposed that the presence of catalyst oscillation provides energy to overcome the principle of microscopic reversibility within the reactive loop, inducing a net flow of surface species about the loop. I use microkinetic modeling to simulate the loop surface reaction on a dynamic catalyst surface. Once the process is determined to have reached steady state, I analyze the system for it's non-equilibrium periodic solution of modulating surface coverages and elementary rates. The periodic solution is reflective of the oscillatory change in catalyst state and, through flux analysis, yields a quantitative output for the rate at which surface species circumfluence about the loop, defined as the loop turnover frequency.
